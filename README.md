# Youtube-Thumbnail-Creater
 In this Project I created a Function in which you passed a parameter and it will generate a Thumbnail of that looks like a Youtube.

## **There are 6 Parameters in the Function**

1. Title: In which you give the title of the Youtube video.
2. Channel Name: In which you give the channel name of the Youtube.
3. Views: You give the Views of the video.
4. Months Old: In which you define how old is the video.
5. Duration: In this you set the duration of the video.
6. Image Source: You give the link of the image source.


## Here is the Screenshot of the Function Created

The Function generates only 1 Thumbnail but in the screenshot above I call the function 3 times so that's why there are 3 Thumbnail in the above screenshot.
